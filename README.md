# readable-random

Gives back a human readable 'random' string. Jsbin style urls.

I made this to get acquainted with grunt together with node modules. Tell me what i'm doing wrong!

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install readable-random`

```javascript
var readableRandom = require('readable-random');
readableRandom.getString(8); // your string, yay
```
